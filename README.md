# Description

This is a sample web API written on Python3 with flask framework.
There is no adequate usage for this API, because it was made only for my education.
Still, there is a small chance that it will evolve in something useful.

## Requirements

- Python3

#### python3 installed modules

- pip
- venv (or virualenv)

## Installation

> *NOTE: use "venv" as the name of virtual environment directory (as below) â€” it's already declared in .gitignore so you won't have to edit this file*

        $ git clone <repo link>
        $ cd sample-http-api
        $ python3 -m venv venv    # venv module usage, use virtualenv here if you want
        $ . venv/bin/activate
        (venv)$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
